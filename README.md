# ML BASED YOGA ASSISTANT
## 1.Introduction
  The Yoga assistant primarily provides a virtual trainer but it also tracks the user activity such as calculating time retained in a particular yoga posture.  

The image classification model is trained with 2 postures of yoga. The dataset used for the project development is an image dataset containing 70-90 images of each class. A pose estimation library called ‘mediapipe’  is used for visualizing and getting the ‘x’, ’y’ coordinates of 33 points on the body. 

  The model can predict which posture the user is trying to do and guide the user by showing the image of a goal posture and needed instructions. The instructions are generated by calculating the angles between the line connecting the coordinates of concerned points.  

The ultimate aim of the project is to display the coordinates, predicted goal posture, instructions to improve and pose time.
## 2.Proof of concept
Finding some time to take care of health is not the only problem. We can find some time and do it at home. But wrongly stretching the body or doing incorrect asanas and breathing in an incorrect manner while exercising, can be detrimental to health.  

Incorrect postures could lead to acute pain and long-standing chronic problems. Making use of videos also cannot solve the problem until we get an active trainer that can correct us when we go wrong. 

 Here comes our yoga assistant to guide you real time. It can predict the posture you are trying to make and guide you to the best posture. It also tracks your activity by showing the pose time, the duration you retain in a particular pose 
 ## 3.Implementation
 The project is implemented by making use of several libraries and techniques. The image dataset is prepared by getting massive number of images from Google browser. The image dataset is preprocessed and given for training. The dataset is split to train, validation and test dataset. A deep learning model is built and is trained by the dataset preprocessed. The plot for loss and accuracy is drawn. The model trained is evaluated by using the test dataset.  Using the mediapipe and open cv library the pose is estimated and x, y coordinates are collected.  
 ### 3.1 System Architecture
 The system architecture is: - The dataset is imported initially from drive and a convolutional neural network is trained by the dataset. An image classification model is thus built and saved for pose prediction. Pose estimation of the input image is done.  
The ‘x’, ‘y’ coordinates are thus got to use for calculating angles later. From the predicted pose, an image/video of goal posture is to be displayed. Using the angle between concerned points, connected by a line, of a particular posture is used for generating instructions. A timer displays the time the user retained in a particular pose.
